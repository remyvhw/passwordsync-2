Password Sync is a secure and fast way to store passwords, documents and credit cards and keep them synchronized across iOS devices.  Password Sync is more than a dumb password manager: it uses your device’s hardware to bring you cutting edge technologies.

- Websites: Usernames, emails, passwords: these are the kind of things you'd expect a password manager to... well... manage. Thankfully, Password Sync works like a charm with these things, you might even stop using the same password everywhere! Actually, we know you will!


- Locations: Your iPhone has a GPS in it. Why not use it to bring you data based on where you are? With Password Sync, you can keep up to 101 residential alarm PINs, gym locker numbers, building access codes and so on. They'll just pop wherever you need them. No need to thank us!


- Cards: You should always keep a copy of your credit card information somewhere safe. Guess what? Password Sync is on of these « somewhere safe » places. And no need to type your credit card number: we'll just scan it for you and fetch your bank details automatically

- Documents: Since your device is equipped with powerful cameras and a powerful encryption software (yep, that's us!), why stop there? Use your iOS device's camera and snap a photo of your most precious documents. They'll sync, fully encrypted, so you can access them everywhere. Just like that!
  Powered by industry standard encryption technologies (AES-256), Password Sync uses the processing power of your device to encrypt and decrypt your passwords in a fast and reliable way. The key used to encrypt your password list is never shared on the network, keeping your data unreadable by anyone but you.  With a clean and to-the-point interface, Password Sync is the password wallet app you'll actually use everyday.
 Even better: it syncs across iPhone/iPod Touch and iPads using iCloud, meaning you can access your password list and modify it from anywhere, even when you're offline. And the modifications you make to your website passwords are saved, giving you a way to go back in time.  For the price of two lattés, Password Sync will keep your data organized and safe.   ---  Password Sync can handle up to 300 items (websites, cards, locations and documents). We do not enforce this limit but be aware performance issues could arise past it. Geofencing requires your permission to work. If you deny Password Sync’s access to your location data, you can always go turn it back from the Settings app. Also, the maximum number of geofenced areas can vary (approximately 10 locations). Finally, we love to hear from you; if you experience any problem, have any question or feel the urge to tell us about this great idea you have to enhance Password Sync, feel free to contact us from our website!
