"A master password is the key that will encode your Password Sync database and is the same for all other devices that have the Password Sync App installed. \nChoose your password carefully: once set, it is absolutely impossible to unlock your passwords without it. If the master password is lost or you find yourself unable to recall it, then you will be unable to retrieve any of your stored passwords.  There is no password retrieval link, nor is there anyone to help you reset it. It is also important to remember that the security level of your data will be proportional to the strength of your password." = "主密碼是保護 Password Sync 數據庫的關鍵密鑰，且在所有安裝 Password Sync 的設備上主密碼都是相同的\n請謹慎選取您的密碼！一旦設置成功，沒有主密碼是絕對無法解鎖您的其他密碼的。如果丟失或您無法記起主密碼，您將無法取回您已存儲的任何密碼信息。沒有密碼取回鏈接，也沒有任何方式能幫助您重置主密碼。另外請牢記，您的數據的安全等級與您的主密碼強度成正比。
