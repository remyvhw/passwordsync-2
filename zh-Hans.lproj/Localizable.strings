"A master password is the key that will encode your Password Sync database and is the same for all other devices that have the Password Sync App installed. \nChoose your password carefully: once set, it is absolutely impossible to unlock your passwords without it. If the master password is lost or you find yourself unable to recall it, then you will be unable to retrieve any of your stored passwords.  There is no password retrieval link, nor is there anyone to help you reset it. It is also important to remember that the security level of your data will be proportional to the strength of your password." = "主密码是保护 Password Sync 数据库的关键密钥，且在所有安装 Password Sync 的设备上主密码都是相同的\n请谨慎选取您的密码！一旦设置成功，没有主密码是绝对无法解锁您的其他密码的。如果丢失或您无法记起主密码，您将无法取回您已存储的任何密码信息。没有密码取回链接，也没有任何方式能帮助您重置主密码。另外请牢记，您的数据的安全等级与您的主密码强度成正比。

"Choose your master password carefully: not only will you have to remember it but it will also encrypt your database. Therefore, it has to be strong yet rememberable.
